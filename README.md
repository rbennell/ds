## What have I already done?

Opened github and logged in to my account <https://github.com/rbennell>

Clicked on the repositories tab. Clicked 'new' and simply copy and pasted the instructions.

## What are we going to do?

* Generate some utility data
* Set up a django project
* Ingest the data
* Set up an api
* Set up a react project
* Visualise it!

Ok, this is a lot, but let's see how we get on.

### Generate some utility data

Let's take a look at generate/generate.py before doing anything. Once we're happy, we'll open a terminal and run the script.
You'll need to change to the /ds directory and run
`$ python3 generate/generate.py`

Lets run it a few more times.

### Set up a django project

We're going to use Django, which is a framework built on python. This will allow us to easily put our data in a database. Let's hop in to the backend directory and take a look at the readme there to get going.
